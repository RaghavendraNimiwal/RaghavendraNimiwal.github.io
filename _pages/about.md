Hi there!

I am a research assitant at [ICTS-TIFR](https://www.icts.res.in) in the [Biophysics Group](https://biophysics.icts.res.in/). I graduated from [BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/) in 2019 with a B.E. (Hons.) in Chemical Engineering and I want to

I have been studying the coupling between biochemical signaling and mechanics to explain how an embryo starting from a single-celled zygotic state develops to its full three-dimensional functional form. The actomyocin cortex of a cell can be consider an active liquid (local energy generation and dissipation) on large time scales with the local concentration of myosin determining the local active stress. The instabilities in these nonlinear mechano-chemical systems can lead to active patterns on cells, which is a prerequisite for any kind of morphogenetic development. We are investigating how the geometry of the cell affects the pattern formation.

As a Long term visiting student at ICTS-TIFR, I mapped Multiconponent Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (MNLS) Equation to Uncoupled Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) Equation using Method of Multiple Scales. KdV equation has special solutions called 'solitons' which balance the nonliear and the dispersive effects in the system resulting in a traveling wave packet. Using this effective maping we can generate similar solutions for MNLS system as well. To read more about the project read ___.
