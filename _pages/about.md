# Hi there!
---
I am currently a research assitant at [ICTS-TIFR](https://www.icts.res.in) in the [Biophysics Group](https://biophysics.icts.res.in/) working on mechano-chemical active patterns on developing embryos. I graduated from [BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/) in 2019 with B.E. (Hons.) in Chemical Engineering and I have been working at ICTS-TIFR since. 

On this site, you can find details about my projects, take a look at various jupyter notebooks I've made to explain different concepts, browse through my publications or view my curriculum vitae. Also, please feel free to get in touch!

## Areas of Expertise
- Numerical Methods- Finite Element Methods, Finite Volume Methods, Finite Difference Methods
- Computational Fluid Dynamics
- Dynamical Systems
- Perturbation Methods
- Fluid Mechanics

I wish to use my skillset to probe various biological phenomenon, learn from them and create solutions for the various problems that we face today.


## August 2020 - Present
I have been studying the coupling between biochemical signaling and mechanics to explain how an embryo starting from a single-celled zygotic state develops to its full three-dimensional functional form. The actomyocin cortex of a cell can be consider an active liquid (local energy generation and dissipation) on large time scales with the local concentration of myosin determining the local active stress. The instabilities in these nonlinear mechano-chemical systems can lead to active patterns on cells, which is a prerequisite for any kind of morphogenetic development. We are investigating how the geometry of the cell affects the pattern formation.

## August 2019 - July 2020 
As a Long term visiting student at ICTS-TIFR, I mapped Multiconponent Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (MNLS) Equation to Uncoupled Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) Equation using Method of Multiple Scales. KdV equation has special solutions called 'solitons' which balance the nonliear and the dispersive effects in the system resulting in a traveling wave packet. Using this effective maping we can generate similar solutions for MNLS system as well. To read more about the project read ___.
