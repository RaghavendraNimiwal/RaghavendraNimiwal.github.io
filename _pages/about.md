## Hi there!
---
I am currently a research assistant at [ICTS-TIFR](https://www.icts.res.in) in the [Biophysics Group](https://biophysics.icts.res.in/) working on mechano-chemical active patterns on developing embryos. I graduated from [BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/) in 2019 with B.E. (Hons.) in Chemical Engineering and I have been working at ICTS-TIFR since. 

On this site, you can find details about my projects, take a look at various jupyter notebooks I've made to explain different concepts, browse through my publications or view my curriculum vitae. Also, please feel free to get in touch!

### Areas of Expertise
- Numerical Methods- Finite Volume Methods, Finite Element Methods
- Computational Fluid Dynamics
- Fluid Mechanics
- Perturbation Methods
- Dynamical Systems

I wish to use my skillset to probe various biological phenomena, learn from them and, create solutions for the various problems that we face today.
