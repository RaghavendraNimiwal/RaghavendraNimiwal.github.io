<!--Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation is ubiquotous in nature, still not much is knowning about the dynamics of the equation. Here we provide a method with which NLS can be mapped to KdV (which is another nonlinear PDE). Since KdV is a well studied system we can know about certain qualitatuive aspects of NLS as well from this effective mapping.-->

<!--KdV has a nonlinear term and a dispersion term, under special conditions you can balance these two effects and you get a travelling wave which is called a soliton. With the effective mapping we figured out such initial conditions for NLS as well.-->

The above movie shows the propagation of two solitons and there interaction.

Thats All !
