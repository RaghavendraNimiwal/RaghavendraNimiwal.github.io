Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation(NLS) is ubiquotous in physics, still not much is knowning about the dynamics of the equation. Through our investigation we found that multicomponent NLS can be mapped to uncoupled Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) Equation. Since KdV is a well studied system we can know about certain qualitatuive aspects of NLS from this mapping. One interesting feature of KdV is that it has special solution called solitons, these special profiles balances the nonliear and the dispersive effects in the system to give traveling wave packets. Leveraging our mapping we kind similar solutions for multicomponent NLS systems as well. 

The multicomponent NLS equation is given by

$$i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi_k}{\partial t} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} - \sum_{j=1}^{j=N}\alpha_{kj}|\psi_j|^2\psi_k + G_{kk}|\psi_k|^4 \psi_k$$

where $\psi_k$ is the wave macroscopic wavefunction, $\alpha$ is the matrix of coupling constants and $G_kk$ is the quintic self-coupling coefficient.

The KdV equation is given by

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + 6u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial ^3 u}{\partial x} = 0 $$

This mapping is done using Method of Multiple Scales and you can read about the it in details in the [project report](https://raghavendranimiwal.github.io/files/Documentation.pdf). The source code which converts any maps multicomponent NLS system to uncoupled KdV system will soon be available open source.

KdV has a nonlinear term and a dispersion term, under special conditions you can balance these two effects and you get a travelling wave which is called a soliton. With the effective mapping we figured out such initial conditions for NLS as well.
